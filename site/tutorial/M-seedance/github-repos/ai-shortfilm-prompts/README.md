This repository is **the complete workflow behind that film**, made
available because Mx-Shell himself published his prompt collection
documents and walked through his entire method on a public Douyin
livestream.

## ⚡ The single-line magic prompt (try it tonight)

Copy this into Sora / Seedance / Kling / Veo. Replace `{{...}}`:

```
Anamorphic widescreen cinematic. Simulated IMAX film camera +
Panavision C-series lens (35mm focal, f/4 aperture). Handheld
shot — extremely subtle, breath-like camera float throughout.
{{your scene description}}.
No score. Production audio only.
```

**Why this works**: real camera bodies + "breath-like float" anchor
the AI to actual film aesthetics — not the vague "cinematic feel"
keyword everyone else uses. Full breakdown in
[methodology.md](./methodology.md).

---

## ❌ vs ✅ — what the method actually changes

Same idea: *a female mech warrior raises an energy shield in a thunderstorm.*

**❌ The naive prompt** (what most people write):

```
Epic cinematic shot of a beautiful female mech warrior activating a
stunning energy shield in the rain. Highly detailed, 4K, photorealistic,
movie-quality, dramatic lighting.
```

Vague praise — *epic / stunning / 4K / movie-quality* — gives the model
nothing concrete to anchor to. You get generic game-CG output.

**✅ With the 5-stage method** (excerpt):

```
Core theme: gritty hard sci-fi mech | rainy dock | battle-damage aesthetic | energy shield | post-apocalyptic live-action
Atmosphere: simulated IMAX film camera + Panavision C-series (35mm, f/4). Low-saturation teal base, film grain.
Camera: handheld — extremely subtle, breath-like float throughout.
9–12s: hexagonal energy cells light up unevenly, some flicker as if faulty; rain bends around a 2m dome.
Ending: no dialogue, no light burst — just rain vaporizing on the shield, a lightning flash across the dock.
```

Real camera/lens names + physical reactions + battle damage + an empty
ending = visceral realism. Full sample with the 10-item self-check:
[examples/02-skill-output-sample.md](./skills/shortfilm-prompt/examples/02-skill-output-sample.md).

## The story

May 2026. A 29-year-old vocational-school graduate from rural Yunnan,
China — handle **Mx-Shell** — used **10 days** and ~20,000 RMB of
cloud credits to make a 3-minute AI short called *Zombie Scavenger*:
an atomic-punk robot wanders into a beachfront villa after a zombie
apocalypse, meets a confused ostrich, and starts dancing
1980s-style breakdance moves while kicking a zombie's head across
the floor.

> On the cost: the widely-quoted "3,000 RMB" figure came from Mx-Shell
> himself, but on livestream he later revised it to "tens of thousands /
> 20k+." The real spend was likely well above 3,000 — still far below a
> comparable live-action shoot.

Hollywood director **PJ Ace (@PJaccetturo)** retweeted the film,
calling it *"one of the best short films I've seen in years"* and started a
search for the author.

A few weeks later Mx-Shell went on a Douyin livestream and **gave
away his entire workflow** — the prompts, the camera language, the
failure modes, the reroll counts.

This repo is the result of digesting 130,000 characters of his
materials into a structured, reusable system.

## TL;DR — The 5-stage prompt structure

<p align="center">
  <img src="./assets/5-stage-structure.svg" alt="The 5-stage prompt structure" width="660">
</p>

Every Mx-Shell video prompt follows the same skeleton. The order matters:

```
1. Core theme            ← 3-6 style tags separated by |
2. Character & scene     ← Face / clothing / environment
3. Atmosphere & quality  ← Visual base / color tone / style core
4. Camera rules          ← Single-shot or multi-shot / angle / breathing
5. Storyboard            ← Per-second OR per-shot breakdown
```

### Three counter-intuitive rules

1. **Specify real camera + lens models.**
   Don't write *"cinematic feel"*. Write
   *"simulated IMAX film camera, Panavision C-series lens, 35mm focal,
   f/4 aperture."* AI training data binds those exact strings to real
   movie aesthetics.

2. **Describe imperfections.**
   *"Battle-damaged armor, paint worn off, oil in the joints, minor
   facial blemishes preserved."* Perfection looks fake. The visceral
   realism comes from the flaws.

3. **Leave the ending empty.**
   *"No dialogue. No explosion. No blinding light.
   Just a figure standing in the smoke, a meteor crossing the sky."*

## Install (Claude Code)

### Option 1 — Plugin Marketplace ⭐ (one-line install)

```
/plugin marketplace add jnMetaCode/ai-shortfilm-prompts
/plugin install ai-shortfilm-prompts@ai-shortfilm-prompts
```

Then in Claude Code:

```
/ai-shortfilm-prompts:shortfilm-prompt  Help me write a 15-second prompt for a
                                        robot transformation, green color palette,
                                        energy core in the belt buckle,
                                        post-apocalyptic jungle background
```

### Option 2 — Try it inside this repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jnMetaCode/ai-shortfilm-prompts.git
cd ai-shortfilm-prompts
claude --plugin-dir .   # then: /ai-shortfilm-prompts:shortfilm-prompt
```

### Option 3 — Make it available globally (manual copy)

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.claude/skills
cp -r ai-shortfilm-prompts/skills/shortfilm-prompt \
      ~/.claude/skills/
```

### Option 4 — As a submodule in your own project

```bash
git submodule add https://github.com/jnMetaCode/ai-shortfilm-prompts.git \
                  vendor/ai-shortfilm-prompts
claude --plugin-dir vendor/ai-shortfilm-prompts   # loads the plugin + skill
```

The Skill walks through the 5-stage structure, runs a 10-item self-check,
and warns you about IP names that may be blocked by Seedance 2.0.

---

## Compatible video models

The 5-stage structure is **model-agnostic**. Here's how the major 2026
engines compare — single-shot ceiling, negative-prompt support, IP filter,
preferred prompt language, and the one gotcha that trips people up:

| Model | Max single shot | Negative prompt | IP filter | Lang | Notes / gotcha |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **[Seedance 2.0](https://dreamina.onelink.me/yKT4/dw7oxbdd)** (Doubao / Jimeng / [Xiaoyunque](https://xiaoyunque.jianying.com/s/ufhQBHB9CHg/), ByteDance) — *Mx-Shell's primary engine* | ~10–15s — but the **Doubao app is locked to 5s/10s preset buttons**; the full 4–15s range only on Jimeng/Dreamina web + VolcEngine console | Partial — no reliable dedicated field in the consumer app; negate by describing what you *do* want | Strict — domestic platforms aggressively reject named celebrities + branded IP | Either (ZH native, EN works) | Duration depends entirely on the front-end. Don't promise 15s if the user is on the Doubao app. Native synced audio-video is its standout strength. |
| **[Veo 3 / 3.1](https://deepmind.google/models/veo/)** (Google) | 8s per clip (4/6/8s); Extend adds 7s hops up to ~148s, but quality degrades after 4–5 extensions | Yes — dedicated field. List unwanted elements as plain nouns (`extra limbs, glitch morphs`); **no `no`/`don't` command phrasing** | Strict — rejects public figures, brands, voice/likeness; scans prompt *and* frames | EN | The negative field wants descriptive phrases, not commands — `no rain` style instructions can backfire. Best-in-class native audio + realism. |
| **[Kling 2.x / 3.0](https://klingai-share.kuaishou.com/h5-app/invitation?code=6BCGZXWZRMA9)** (Kuaishou) | 2.5: 5–10s (Pro ~12s); **3.0: up to ~15s single-prompt** multi-shot | Yes — dedicated field. Use for stability artifacts (sliding feet, extra fingers, morphing), not generic "quality" words | Strict — a pre-gen banned-word filter rejects the **whole prompt** on one match; hypersensitive | Either (ZH native, EN strong; 3.0 multilingual dialogue) | The banned-word filter is notoriously over-sensitive — a benign body/contact word can block a clean prompt. Sanitize wording first. Excellent action/motion realism. |
| **[Hailuo / MiniMax](https://hailuoai.video/)** (02 / 2.3) | ~6–10s — 1080p caps ~6s, 768p extends ~10s | Yes — but vendor guidance says use sparingly, for specific artifacts not as a primary lever | Moderate — more permissive than Sora/Veo, still blocks named celebs + overt IP | Either (ZH native, EN solid) | Resolution and duration trade off — you can't get max of both. Pick the axis that matters per shot. Strong motion at low cost. |
| **[Wan 2.x](https://tongyi.aliyun.com/)** (Alibaba, open-source) | 2.2: ~3–8s @ 24–30fps; 2.5/2.6 extend ~10–15s by mode | Yes — robust field; defaults like `morphing, warping, face deformation, flickering` | Lenient — open-weights/self-hostable, so **no enforced filter when run locally** (hosted APIs may add their own) | Native ZH (both, but ZH-trained) | Leans Chinese — first/last-frame mode especially; EN-only prompts can underperform, add ZH for tricky shots. Self-hostable, full ComfyUI control, renders legible ZH/EN on-screen text. |
| **[Runway Gen-4 / 4.5](https://runwayml.com/)** | 5s or 10s per generation | **No — does NOT support negatives.** `avoid X / no X` can produce the opposite. Describe only what *should* appear | Strict — blocks celebs, real people, copyrighted characters/brands | EN | Negative prompts are actively harmful here — `no distorted hands` can summon distorted hands. The single biggest mistake when porting prompts. Director-grade camera control + mature pro pipeline. |
| **[Pika](https://pika.art/)** (2.2 / 2.5) | Standard + Pikascenes: 5s or 10s; **Pikaframes (keyframe) up to ~25s** | Partial — 2.5 supports negatives (`no morphing, no extra limbs`); 2.2 unclear, verify in-app | Moderate — blocks overt celebs/IP, generally more relaxed than Sora/Veo | EN | Only the Pikaframes keyframe path reaches ~25s — ordinary text/image-to-video is still 5s/10s. Fast, effects/transition-driven, great for stylized short-form. |
| **[Sora 2 / 2 Pro](https://sora.com/)** (OpenAI) | Up to ~25s continuous single-pass on Sora 2 Pro (standard tier shorter) | No dedicated field — negate in-prompt with guardrails like `original characters only, no logos or text` | Strict — triple-layer moderation; blocks named IP **and visual lookalikes** even without the name | EN | The filter catches *descriptions*, not just names — `a spiky-haired ninja in an orange jumpsuit` still trips it (matches Naruto). Avoid recognizable trait-bundles, not only proper nouns. Leading prompt comprehension + world coherence. |

<sub>Durations and negative-prompt mechanics for Veo 3.1, Runway Gen-4, Kling,
Wan, and Sora are consistent across multiple 2026 vendor/help-doc sources;
Seedance 2.0 and Hailuo figures lean on third-party guides (treat `~` as
approximate). "Veo ~148s", "Sora/Pika ~25s" come from extension/keyframe
features, **not** plain single-shot generation. IP-filter "strictness" labels
are qualitative.</sub>
