**Turn an idea into a directed video prompt.** Seedance 2.0 Skill OS is an agent
skill for planning shots, binding references and continuing from an accepted
clip. Your video provider handles generation and its costs.

## Start Here

After installation, tell your agent what happens and what must stay fixed:

> Use seedance-20. A person finishes a paper fan at a workbench. Keep it quiet,
> with one static shot and no music. Give me the prompt only.

One possible draft:

```text
Locked tabletop shot. Two hands
finish the last fold of a paper
fan and let go. The fan settles
on the wood. Hold still for one
beat. Warm desk-lamp light;
dry paper rustle and room tone.
No music.
```

**Why these choices:** one visible action, a clear endpoint, a fixed camera and
an explicit sound choice. Duration and aspect ratio belong in your provider's
controls when that surface owns them. This is an unrendered teaching example;
it does not establish successful folding, motion or audio generation.

For another treatment, choose calm observation, a playful gag or a step-by-step
demonstration. Tell the agent which one you want to keep. A draft can be revised
without submitting a paid generation request.

## Choose a workflow

| What you have | What to provide next |
|---|---|
| A rough idea | The action, feeling and delivery format; ask for a few distinct choices. |
| A prompt to improve | The draft and constraints you want preserved. |
| Image, video or audio references | Actual files and the role each should control. |
| An accepted clip to continue | Its observed ending and the next action. |
| A result that missed | The failed requirement and your remaining revision budget. |

Start with the [quickstart](docs/QUICKSTART.md),
[reference workflow](references/reference-workflow.md),
[continuation guide](skills/seedance-continuation/SKILL.md) or
[retake protocol](references/retake-protocol.md).

## Install

Get a local copy, then run the installer from that folder. This example selects
Codex user scope; other clients and replacement details are below.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Emily2040/seedance-2.0.git
cd seedance-2.0
python scripts/install_codex_skill.py --client codex --scope user
```

Download ZIP also works: extract it and run the installer inside that folder.
Restart your client, then select `seedance-20`. Review the
[security policy](SECURITY.md) before configuring optional provider tools.
Prompt preparation does not authorize paid generation.

<details>
<summary>Installation by client, replacement and recovery details</summary>

Client support for Agent Skills is still tool-specific. See [observed compatibility and the host smoke protocol](https://github.com/Emily2040/seedance-2.0/blob/main/docs/HOST_COMPATIBILITY.md) for tested revisions and explicit gaps. Codex documents a skill as a directory with a required `SKILL.md`, optional `scripts/`, `references/`, `assets/`, and optional `agents/` metadata.

Codex scans `.agents/skills` locations from the working directory upward, plus user/admin/system skill locations. A repository root with `SKILL.md` is shaped like a skill folder, but it still needs to be installed/copied under a scanned skills directory or distributed as a plugin for automatic discovery.

### Step 1 — get the files

Every install path below runs from inside a local copy of this repository, so start here:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Emily2040/seedance-2.0.git
cd seedance-2.0
```

Without `git` installed, use the green **Code → Download ZIP** button on the repository page, unzip it, and change into the unzipped folder instead. Nothing else on this page works until one of those two has happened.

### Step 2 — install it into your client

The installer is not Codex-only. Choose a client and scope below, or point `--dest` at another client's documented skills parent directory:

```bash
# Codex — user scope at ~/.agents/skills
python scripts/install_codex_skill.py --client codex --scope user

# Claude Code — personal install at ~/.claude/skills
python scripts/install_codex_skill.py --client claude-code --scope user

# One existing project, outside this source checkout
python scripts/install_codex_skill.py --client codex --scope project --project-root /path/to/project

# Any other client — use its documented skills parent directory
python scripts/install_codex_skill.py --dest /path/to/client/skills
```

Choose either `--dest` or `--client` with `--scope`; project scope requires an
existing `--project-root` and never guesses from your current directory. The
[scope guide](https://github.com/Emily2040/seedance-2.0/blob/main/docs/INSTALL_SCOPES.md)
explains the paths. No-option commands preserve the historical
`$CODEX_HOME/skills` or `~/.codex/skills` default for existing workflows; they do
not migrate old copies. Use the same destination options with the read-only
`install_doctor.py` before deciding on replacement.

The command stages and validates the repository before promoting it to
`<dest>/seedance-20`, then prints where it landed. Concurrent installers
sharing that destination are serialized. Add `--force` only to replace a
complete existing install. Automatic retry is limited to states for which every
authority record required by the phase reached is present, has flushed file
contents and, on POSIX, a flushed containing-directory publication, and still
validates. Each payload file is first written under a transaction-derived
sibling name, bounded by the recorded size, synced, checked against the recorded
digest, atomically published at its final stage pathname, and followed by a
containing-directory sync on POSIX. A crash therefore leaves that final pathname
absent or complete, never truncated. The copy-sibling basename is capped at 34
ASCII bytes, shorter than the provenance marker already created before copying;
on POSIX it shortens further if the stage reports a smaller component limit.
Shortened names retain a transaction-and-path digest, and any namespace
collision makes staging fail closed before payload copying begins. This bound
applies only to copy siblings: the installer still requires the filesystem to
represent its longer stage and authority names, so it makes no end-to-end claim
for unusually small component limits. Recoverable states include an
exact empty stage before provenance publication; after complete provenance
publication, source-identical final payload files plus the one exact transaction-
bound in-progress sibling; an exact torn prefix of the installer's expected
provenance or completion record; and a deletion workspace bound by its external
transaction journal (plus the exact empty terminal workspace left if that
journal was already removed). Malformed, swapped, or otherwise untrusted records
and late or unexpected bytes are preserved for inspection. A truncated file at
an expected final payload pathname and an unbound temp-like file are likewise
never claimed for automatic cleanup.
So are the deliberately fail-closed hard-death windows after a quarantine is
renamed but before its authority marker is published, or after a private
deletion workspace is created but before its external journal is published.
During replacement, the previous copy remains available for rollback until the
validated stage is promoted. Restart your client afterwards so `seedance-20`
appears in its skill list.

On Windows, authority and deletion handles share reads only and remain open
through their consuming action; a pre-existing or newly requested writable or
deletion handle therefore makes the installer fail closed. On POSIX, verified
objects are moved into a journal-bound mode-`0700` workspace before unlink,
which excludes other OS accounts and narrows the deletion namespace. POSIX
`flock` and owner-only directory permissions are not mandatory isolation from a
hostile process running as the same account. Such a process may retain or open
writable descriptors and mutate either the workspace or its containing skills
directory; all of those capabilities are outside the portable guarantee. The
installer preserves mismatches it observes, but makes no stronger exclusion
claim against that same-account adversary.

On POSIX, authority records are flushed before their containing directory, and
transaction namespace renames and removals are followed by directory `fsync`.
Each copied payload file is individually `fsync`ed before its atomic rename, and
that file's containing stage directory is `fsync`ed after the rename. The
transaction does not recursively flush the supplied skills-directory ancestry;
that ancestry is assumed to have the durability expected by the caller.

Only manifest-declared files and their implied directories are created. Source
permissions are not inherited: POSIX stage/live directories are normalized to
`0700` and files to `0600`. Named streams, extended attributes, and resource
forks on the source root, declared files, or implied directories are refused
before transaction authority is published, because the portable install
contract cannot represent them.
Installs skip the quarantined `references/migrated/` history, the image gallery (about 18 MB of PNGs), the test suite, and the network-capable evaluator. The installer replaces the omitted gallery embeds with one repository link, so the installed README does not contain broken local asset targets.

A destination inside this repository is refused rather than attempted because it would mutate the source authority domain while the payload is being authenticated. For a project-local install, run the script from the project you are installing into, by absolute path, as above.

This repository keeps dense facts in references so the active skill stays small.

For a client that imports a local skill folder, first prepare the filtered payload in a new staging directory outside this checkout:

```bash
python scripts/install_codex_skill.py --dest /absolute/path/to/new-staging/skills
```

Import the resulting `skills/seedance-20/` folder, or run the installer with `--dest` set directly to the skills parent directory your client scans. Keep the directory name `seedance-20` and its relative layout. A raw repository clone or a client-managed GitHub import may include the evaluator, provider helpers, tests and archives; it does not carry the installer's filtered-payload guarantee. Inspect how that client packages files before using a direct import. See [manual transfer and verification](https://github.com/Emily2040/seedance-2.0/blob/main/docs/MANUAL_INSTALL.md).

Treat the table below as common local targets to verify in your own client, not a universal support guarantee.

| Platform | Typical install target (verify in your client) |
|---|---|
| Claude Code | `~/.claude/skills/seedance-20/` (personal) or `.claude/skills/seedance-20/` (project) — both via `scripts/install_codex_skill.py --dest` |
| Codex | project `.agents/skills/seedance-20/` or user `~/.agents/skills/seedance-20/`; no-option installer keeps its historical path |
| Google Antigravity | `.agents/skills/seedance-20/` (workspace) or `~/.gemini/config/skills/seedance-20/` (global across Antigravity products) |
| OpenClaw | workspace `skills/seedance-20/` or `~/.openclaw/skills/seedance-20/` via `openclaw skills install` (ClawHub-compatible; skills already carry `openclaw:` metadata) |
| Hermes Agent | `~/.hermes/skills/seedance-20/` (primary); a project `skills/seedance-20/` directory is discovered only after its parent is added to `skills.external_dirs` in `~/.hermes/config.yaml` |
| Gemini CLI-style workspace | `.gemini/skills/seedance-20/` |
| GitHub Copilot workspace | `.github/skills/seedance-20/` |
| Cursor workspace | `.cursor/skills/seedance-20/` |
| Windsurf workspace | `.windsurf/skills/seedance-20/` |
| Trae (ByteDance) | `.trae/skills/seedance-20/` |
| Qwen Code (Alibaba) | `.qwen/skills/seedance-20/` or `~/.qwen/skills/seedance-20/` |
| OpenCode | `.opencode/skills/seedance-20/` (also reads `.claude/skills/` and `.agents/skills/`) |
| Amp (Sourcegraph) | `.agents/skills/seedance-20/` or `~/.config/agents/skills/seedance-20/` |
| Goose (Block) | `.agents/skills/seedance-20/` (also `.goose/skills/seedance-20/`) |
| Junie (JetBrains) | `.junie/skills/seedance-20/` or `~/.junie/skills/seedance-20/` |

Several of these clients share the `.agents/skills/` convention — Codex, Google Antigravity, OpenCode, Amp, and Goose all read it — so one install under `.agents/skills/seedance-20/` can serve them together, and `.claude/skills/` is read by many as a compatibility path. Install once as the `seedance-20` root skill; its sub-skills and references resolve by relative path.

## What This Skill Does

This skill package turns Seedance 2.0 work into a repeatable assistant workflow:

- Routes vague ideas into short creative interviews instead of premature prompt dumps.
- Directs each scene before drafting: reads its dramatic function, sets one directorial voice, and makes camera, light, blocking, performance, and sound serve a single intention instead of a generic "cinematic" look - and holds that voice across every clip of a long story.
- Writes full or compressed prompts for T2V, I2V, V2V, R2V, FLF2V, edit, extend, audio-aware, and first/last-frame workflows.
- Separates every reference asset by role: identity, environment, motion, camera rhythm, audio tempo, style, or endpoint.
- Keeps model and platform claims source-dated so API, pricing, region, quota, and model-ID details are not guessed.
- Plans into model strengths before drafting: a capability map, a fidelity-allocation model, and a working model of the generator's mechanics that explains why every rule works.
- Runs the shoot like a producer after generation: five-verdict take triage, one-variable retakes, attempt budgets, and cost-aware drafting.
- Provides front-page reader paths plus deeper multilingual cinematic vocabulary in English, 中文, 日本語, 한국어, Spanish, and Russian, including role binding, first/last-frame phrasing, edit/extend wording, safety wording, audio cues, continuation wording, and post-production text handling.
- Adds original community-informed examples for Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Russian-English, and Spanish-English prompt structures.
- Adds professional filmmaker workflows for treatment-to-shot-list planning, shot contracts, continuity ledgers, ACES/color handoff, audio post, subtitles/localization, aspect-ratio variants, campaign cutdowns, delivery/QC, and client review packets.
- Handles safe false-positive repairs by clarifying benign production context, not by hiding unsafe intent.
- Rewrites unsafe celebrity, protected IP, private-person, brand, logo, song, or voice requests into safer creative equivalents.
- Diagnoses failed outputs with concrete repair levers: camera, lighting, motion, reference role, duration, framing, audio, or safety wording.
- Ships validation scripts, eval cases, source data, and design checks so maintainers can review changes before release.

## Final hardening contract

The 2026-08-05 audit closed four concrete gaps in the current v6.7.0 tree:

| Boundary | Current behavior |
|---|---|
| Frame extraction | `extract_last_frame.py` shares a 120-second FFmpeg budget across probe/decode/verify/encode; use `--timeout-seconds` to choose another positive limit. It bounds pipe output, retains 800 diagnostic bytes and restricts input protocols to file/pipe. Timeout cleanup may add up to 10 seconds; this is not a filesystem sandbox. Current `-fps_mode passthrough` and legacy `-vsync 0` remain supported. |
| Copyable prompts | Generic reference-package examples use canonical `@Video1` and `@Image1` when the repository authors the tag; user- or interface-supplied spellings such as `[Video 1]` and `@Image 1` remain byte-preserved. Continuations begin from accepted footage's observed end state, and showcase prompts carry brief-specific behavior, props, timing, sound, and endpoints. |
| Evaluator ledgers | A new ledger is published from a retained file descriptor or handle relative to a retained directory descriptor or handle. Late destination claimants and namespace substitutes remain untouched; unsupported safe-publication paths fail closed. |
| Windows release tooling | Runner trust follows the exact venv launcher CPython installs across 3.11–3.13, including the 3.13 launcher variants. The Windows CI matrix exercises all three supported versions. |

These checks verify repository contracts, prompt structure, and the tested local tooling. They do not guarantee the subjective quality of every generated clip, prove that every third-party agent host auto-loads the skill, or replace a live Seedance generation benchmark. See the [v6.7.0 release note](docs/RELEASE_v6.7.0.md) for the full audit result.

## Making Videos Longer Than One Generation

Do not blindly ask the skill to extend the original prompt. A continuation must be based on accepted generated footage because Seedance may not end exactly where the original prompt expected.

1. Describe the complete idea and how it ends.
2. The skill divides it into connected clips.
3. Generate Clip 01.
4. Return the generated clip or its final frame.
5. The skill records what actually happened.
6. It writes Clip 02 from the real ending.
7. Repeat until the planned final outcome is reached.

The project state is the source of truth. The clip contract is the current production task. The prompt is a compiled instruction for only that task. Accepted generated footage determines what happens next.

## Professional Filmmaker Scope

This package is designed for working film and commercial teams, not only for casual prompt writing. It can help an agent produce the artifact the role actually needs:

| Role | What the skill should produce |
|---|---|
| Director | treatment, scene beat, performance intent, coverage, shot endpoint, review notes |
| Cinematographer / DP | shot contract, shot size, lens feel, camera support, movement, blocking, lighting continuity |
| Producer / agency | client brief, rights map, approval gates, campaign variants, risk log, review packet |
| Editor | selects plan, edit/extend decision, continuity handoff, handles, textless needs, conform notes |
| Colorist | color intent, ACES-aware handoff, show-look notes, HDR/SDR caveats, product-color checks |
| Sound team | dialogue map, ambience/SFX/music layers, sync cues, stems, M&E, dubbing and loudness notes |
| Localization team | subtitles, SDH captions, forced narratives, dubbing guide, market copy, textless plates |
| Delivery/QC | frame rate, aspect ratio, crop, color, loudness, captions, metadata, naming, human QC checklist |

For these requests, the skill should not stop at a single prompt. It should return the production object first, then the Seedance prompt or prompt batch that fits inside that plan.

## Current Status Rule

Seedance platform behavior changes quickly. Before making factual claims about API availability, face or portrait authorization, upload limits, pricing, regional availability, or model names, load [`references/api-status.md`](references/api-status.md) and check its `last_verified` date.

**This is a Seedance 2.0 skill.** ByteDance's [official Seedance 2.5 model page](https://seed.bytedance.com/en/seedance2_5)
confirms a separate newer line, and [Dreamina's official product page](https://dreamina.capcut.com/seedance/seedance-2-5) says it is live on Dreamina.
Neither primary page gives an exact launch date, and API or other-surface availability remained unconfirmed in the 2026-08-01 review.
The newer line is out of scope here — craft may transfer, but every platform number below is a 2.0 number.
Establish which line a surface runs before quoting one. See [`api-status.md`](references/api-status.md).

As of 2026-06-20, public official sources describe Seedance 2.0 as supporting text, image, audio, and video inputs. Official launch and model-card material says references can include up to 9 images, 3 video clips, and 3 audio clips.

Volcengine and BytePlus docs now expose Seedance 2.0 Mini as a surface-specific model lane. Treat `Seedance V2 Mini` as shorthand for Seedance 2.0 Mini only when the active surface confirms it. Current source-visible IDs include `doubao-seedance-2-0-mini-260615` on Volcengine and `dreamina-seedance-2-0-mini-260615` on BytePlus.

Volcengine docs also keep `doubao-seedance-2-0-260128` and `doubao-seedance-2-0-fast-260128` visible as Ark model IDs and document first/last-frame role usage on that surface. Runway documents `seedance2` with 5-15 second duration and optional image, video, and audio references.

Third-party provider/router pages tracked as of 2026-06-20 include EvoLink, OpenRouter, Kie.ai, PiAPI, LaoZhang, Runware, ModelsLab, AI/ML API, MuAPI, SeeGen, and Segmind.

Treat every endpoint, model ID, price, account requirement, face/reference policy, and output-rights claim as provider-specific and recheck live before implementation. China-facing searches should prefer official ByteDance, Volcengine, BytePlus, Doubao, Jimeng/Jianying, and CapCut/Jianying surfaces; workflow hosts or business-partner news are not public API providers unless they publish provider-owned API docs.

Access, pricing, upload limits, regions, resolution, audio-combination rules, and authorization requirements remain surface-specific.

## V6 Research and Claim Boundary

The v6 release line keeps a dated research layer for safer data mining, multilingual prompting, sequence-state work, and platform claims:

- [`research-2026-05-30.md`](references/research-2026-05-30.md) records official and field-observed signals.
- [`platform-surface-matrix.md`](references/platform-surface-matrix.md) separates model capability from Dreamina/Jimeng, Volcengine/Ark, BytePlus, ComfyUI, and provider/router behavior.
- [`model-name-map.md`](references/model-name-map.md) prevents `Seedance 2.0`, `Seedance 2.0 Fast`, `Seedance 2.0 Mini`, `Seedance V2`, and ambiguous Pro labels from being mixed together.
- [`community-source-methodology.md`](references/community-source-methodology.md) explains how to mine public prompt corpora without copying unsafe examples.
- [`multilingual-community-examples.md`](references/multilingual-community-examples.md) captures safe mixed-language and localized prompt structures from community pattern mining.
- [`pro-filmmaking-standards.md`](references/pro-filmmaking-standards.md) adds industry workflow boundaries for shot lists, continuity, color, audio, localization, and delivery.

## Operating System At A Glance

![Seedance 2.0 Skill OS operating diagram: seven gates feed the seedance-20 root, which routes to the core pipeline, governance, and multilingual vocabulary clusters, backed by the reference library and validators](assets/skill-map.svg)

The diagram is the contract: every request passes the gates, the root routes it, and the validators hold the line. Six lanes stay separate by design:

- Research sources: dated official, academic, platform, and community evidence.
- Production spine: brief, shot list, continuity, post handoff, localization, and delivery/QC.
- Prompt router: interview, prompt writing, compression, recipes, and troubleshooting.
- Multimodal references: image, video, audio, first-frame, last-frame, and role-bound assets.
- Safety gates: IP, likeness, voice, brand, real-person, filter, and platform-policy checks.
- Quality evals: schema checks, source freshness, vocabulary integrity, design audit, and behavior cases.

## Skill Map

### Core Pipeline

| Skill | Use when |
|---|---|
| [`seedance-interview`](skills/seedance-interview/SKILL.md) | The idea is vague, undeveloped, or needs creative direction. |
| [`seedance-interview-short`](skills/seedance-interview-short/SKILL.md) | The user wants a fast brief, not a long interview. |
| [`seedance-sequence`](skills/seedance-sequence/SKILL.md) | The request is a long story, connected clip set, campaign sequence, or multi-generation scene. |
| [`seedance-continuation`](skills/seedance-continuation/SKILL.md) | The user wants to continue, extend, repair a tail, bridge known states, or re-anchor accepted footage. |
| [`seedance-prompt`](skills/seedance-prompt/SKILL.md) | The user needs a complete prompt from a clear concept. |

### Governance and Quality

| Skill | Use when |
|---|---|
| [`seedance-copyright`](skills/seedance-copyright/SKILL.md) | Protected IP, public figures, real people, brands, logos, songs, or exact scenes appear. |
| [`seedance-antislop`](skills/seedance-antislop/SKILL.md) | Prompt language is generic, bloated, or filled with empty quality boosters. |
| [`seedance-filter`](skills/seedance-filter/SKILL.md) | A benign prompt is blocked or degraded by over-broad filtering. Repairs false positives by clarifying legitimate production context, never by hiding intent. |

### Multilingual Vocabulary

## Multilingual Start / 多语言入门 / 多言語スタート / 다국어 시작

Seedance 2.0 Skill OS is English-readable, but the v6 line gives Chinese, Japanese, and Korean readers first-class entry points, active example skills, and language-specific prompt guidance.
Keep reference tags exactly as written (`@Image1`, `@Video1`, `@Audio1`, `@图片1`, `@视频1`) in every language.
Static checks preserve structure and tokens; linguistic and authorship questions follow the independent human-review protocol.
Use the independent [`multilingual language review`](references/multilingual-native-review.md) rubric for language-quality review.
Every material score must cite its pinned criterion-specific localized candidate text and carry a criterion-specific reason, never the common brief alone.
Completed records belong in the CI-validated evidence artifact; it is currently empty, so no completed native-language review is claimed.

<summary>Maintainer validation and design documentation</summary>

## Validation

<!-- installed-readme-validation:start -->

The validation toolchain supports **CPython 3.11 through 3.13**. CI exercises
both endpoints on Ubuntu and Windows; intermediate CPython 3.12 releases remain
inside the supported range. Python 3.10 and 3.14 are outside this lock's
supported range.

Run these checks before every release. The offline source-metadata check runs with
`--enforce-freshness` here so an old checked-in registry stamp blocks a release;
per-pull-request validation deliberately omits the flag, because metadata age
depends on the calendar rather than on the change under test.

The checks themselves are offline after their build dependencies are installed.
Two maintainer checks need third-party libraries: `schema_check.py` executes JSON
Schema instances, while `build_masthead_outlines.py --check` reproduces the
outlined masthead type. Install both hash-pinned toolchains first — the masthead
installer rebuilds a dedicated checkout-specific temp venv, resolves the lock
from the checkout, and creates it with `--without-pip`. Before that new venv's
launcher can bootstrap pip or install anything, the parent publishes and re-reads
an external initialized trust record for the runner and config. Only that
verified path may run bundled `ensurepip` and force-reinstall the locked wheels.
The installer retains the exact selected wheel bytes, validates pip's
install-report hashes against the lock, and seals
every installed distribution file from `RECORD`. Each installed import payload
must also match the retained locked wheel byte-for-byte. Verification and
rendering then require an external, checkout-keyed trust record that binds the
venv runner, `pyvenv.cfg`, builder script, lock, and sealed marker; the runner
must independently match the current Python installation's stdlib venv launcher.
They run in a fresh `python -I -S -B` child that exposes the sealed site-packages
only after startup, so `PYTHONPATH`, `sitecustomize`, `.pth` processing, a forged
venv runner, a parent preload, or a same-version replacement cannot skip hash
verification or shape the output:

`schema_check.py` proves structure and record-local constraints; it does not and
cannot prove graph-wide lineage. `project_state_check.py` and
`continuity_chain_check.py` are mandatory alongside it for duplicate IDs,
parent existence and order, cycles, executable parent-state continuity, and
binding every post-review clip status to its current take history and sibling
take-review record. Both semantic validators share the same bounded review
index; authority candidates must be stable regular non-link files no larger
than 1 MiB, their captured bytes are capped at 16 MiB per directory, and neither
validator accepts a project-state document as its own review.
Passing the schema alone is never a valid release or handoff gate.

`source_registry_check.py` parses the explicit `last_verified` field, rejects
missing, malformed, duplicate, or future stamps, and compares the checked-in
metadata dates of freshness-critical references. It does not fetch URLs and it
does not prove that any upstream claim is still true. A human or separately
authorized live-verification process must re-read the cited sources and update
the claims before changing a stamp.

```bash
python -m pip install --require-hashes --requirement requirements-validation.lock
python -I -S -B scripts/build_masthead_outlines.py --install-build-deps
```

```bash
python -I -S -B scripts/build_masthead_outlines.py --check
python scripts/validate_repo.py --release
```

`validate_repo.py` resolves the repository from its own file location and does
not call Git, so this release path also works from a Download ZIP extraction,
from a nested caller directory, and from a path containing spaces. The separate
masthead-outline check preserves its sealed build-environment trust boundary;
the runner covers the remaining canonical validators, tests, and an in-memory
source compilation that writes no bytecode.

### Git checkout-only hygiene

After the archive-safe checks, a maintainer working in a Git checkout should
also run:

```bash
git diff --check
```

This whitespace check requires Git metadata. Do not run it in a Download ZIP
extraction.

`prompt_architecture_stress.py` is a deterministic failure gate, not a creativity
or originality judge. In strict mode, every applicable dimension on every
`skill_formula` case must score at least 3, the arm average must remain at least
3.5, and materially different briefs may not reuse duplicate or near-duplicate
prompts. Its mechanical checks cover shooting-brief structure, brief-specific
traceability beyond generic production words, explicit camera/light/sound/action
contradictions, and repetition or padding patterns. Comparative creative quality
still requires blinded model evaluation and native-language human review.

The CI workflow runs the same archive-safe runner on push and pull request, with
the one deliberate difference noted above: it omits `--enforce-freshness`.
Checkout-only whitespace hygiene remains a separate CI step. These checks are
deterministic and offline — they prove the package is well-formed.

The multilingual fixture check proves byte-exact reference-token preservation,
canonical common-brief and candidate bindings, non-derived complete review-input
pins, literal identical-string overlap across locale realizations, and the exact
path, bytes, and digest of the canonical limitation disclaimer. It also runs a
best-effort English known-phrase lint across declared public text surfaces. That
lint is defense in depth, not proof that arbitrary prose or every supported
language contains no semantic overclaim. Translated or paraphrased template
detection, semantic differentiation, and reviewer-reasoning adequacy remain
independent human-review questions under
[`multilingual-native-review.md`](references/multilingual-native-review.md).

### Checked-in source metadata age

Whether `references/source-registry.md` is stale depends on today's date, not on
the change being tested, so it is not asked per pull request — that would fail
unrelated work on a calendar boundary. It is asked in two places instead:

| Where | Behaviour |
|---|---|
| Release checklist above | `--enforce-freshness` blocks a release when the checked-in registry stamp is older than 30 days |
| `source-freshness-review.yml` | Runs Mondays 09:00 UTC on the default branch and reports metadata age as clean, drifting (past 14 days), or stale (past 30) |

Drift and staleness are tracked in a single automatically maintained issue. It
opens when the registry first drifts, is refreshed in place each week rather
than re-notifying, and closes itself once the registry is back inside the
window.

The scheduled job never edits the registry. Re-stamping `last_verified` without
actually re-reading the upstream sources would record a verification that never
happened, so refreshing it is deliberately a human step. A clean metadata-age
result means only that the recorded review date is recent enough; it is not a
live source or claim verification.

For a future paid comparison, the [capped rendered pilot](evals/capped-rendered-pilot.md) defines 12 briefs, two arms and two takes, with a 16-attempt canary inside a 48-attempt ceiling. Its schedule is unexecuted; actual assets, settings, pricing and spending authorization must be supplied before a run.

To prove the package is also *good*, run the model-in-the-loop harness. Its
discovery phase sees the root router and a safe catalog, not the expected route
labels; the responder receives only the sources it selected, and the judge then
scores the answer against [`eval-rubric.md`](references/eval-rubric.md):

```bash
# No network, credential read or ledger write: inspect the selected work first.
python scripts/eval_run.py --limit 1

# Explicit, bounded live smoke run. Supply the key through your environment.
python scripts/eval_run.py --live --limit 1 --max-calls 3 --max-output-tokens 3300 \
  --ledger eval-runs/smoke.md --stamp 2026-09-05

# Preview an alternate provider/region before choosing a live ceiling.
python scripts/eval_run.py --provider minimax --region global_en --limit 1
python scripts/eval_run.py --provider minimax --region cn_zh --model MiniMax-M2.7 --limit 1
python scripts/eval_run.py --provider orcarouter --limit 1
```

The optional [OrcaRouter evaluator](docs/ORCAROUTER_EVAL.md) uses its native Messages endpoint and a restricted Claude allowlist. Its default is also an offline plan.

For advisory current/proposed/plain comparisons, use the [outcome protocol](references/outcome-comparison.md). It separates useful behavior from exact route agreement, preserves hard gates, and produces no aggregate score for incomplete runs. This offline support does not replace release evaluation.

Without `--live`, the harness prints an offline JSON plan, even if a key or
`--ledger` is supplied. `--self-test` remains the separate offline wiring check.
A live run uses `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` or `MINIMAX_API_KEY` from the environment.
Each attempted request reserves one call and its requested maximum output tokens
before transport; failed requests do not refund that reservation. The default
ceilings are three calls and 3,300 output tokens per selected case. A full suite
requires an explicit `--max-calls`; inspect the plan and choose your ceiling.
Only a complete run may replace `evals/eval-run-ledger.md`.

Exhausting a ceiling stops the run with an incomplete/error assessment. The final
console summary reports attempted calls, reserved output tokens and validated
provider-reported usage; preserve that summary with the run log. Input tokens,
cache charges and currency cost are not capped or estimated, and failed requests
may still be billed. No live quality result is implied by an offline plan.


The harness uses `Authorization: Bearer <API_KEY>` as documented by both the
[global](https://platform.minimax.io/docs/api-reference/text-chat-anthropic) and
[CN](https://platform.minimaxi.com/docs/api-reference/text-chat-anthropic)
Anthropic-compatible Messages endpoints. Those provider contracts were checked
directly on 2026-08-01: both list the same eight supported models and the common
successful-response fields (`id`, `type`, `role`, `model`, `content`,
`stop_reason`, and `usage`), without requiring either `base_resp` or
`stop_sequence`. Anthropic's own response contract is validated separately,
including its required `stop_sequence` field.

Successful bodies are validated fail-closed: documented optional usage,
citation, thinking, and tool-call structures are type-checked with unknown
fields rejected, while optional MiniMax legacy `base_resp`/`stop_sequence`
fields cannot contradict an otherwise successful response. M2.x thinking
blocks are accepted only in their documented shape; unrequested tool calls and
Anthropic/M3 thinking are rejected as non-final evidence. Transport errors name
the failed open, context-entry, or read phase and redact API keys before console
or ledger output. Generated ledger commands are emitted separately for POSIX
shells and PowerShell, and are omitted when metadata is not safe to round-trip.

Before either offline or live evaluation starts, the harness resolves every eval
input through [`evals/source-manifest.json`](evals/source-manifest.json), rejects
unclassified files, symlinks/reparse aliases, hard-link aliases, and digest
drift, then freezes the verified UTF-8 bytes for the whole run. The root router,
rubric, eval suite, fixture data, evaluator harness, planner catalog, responder
context, judge, and ledger therefore share one immutable source view. State
fixtures are strict JSON objects under `evals/fixtures/`; models receive the data
but never the fixture path. The judge receives the rubric, case prompt, expected
output, checks, and candidate response, but never expected route labels or
selected source paths. The harness also compiles the frozen evaluator source and
requires it to equal the module code object Python actually executed, with the
same physical `scripts/eval_run.py` path. Every recheck derives path, role, and
digest metadata again from the frozen manifest so a constructed snapshot cannot
reclassify responder files as evaluator-only inputs. A post-run check plus checks
immediately before and after the atomic ledger replace refuse release evidence
if any input changed after the snapshot; a failed post-replace check restores the
prior ledger. For a newly created destination, it invalidates only the retained
published inode to zero length through its open descriptor; a concurrent
namespace substitute is preserved untouched. That first publication is also
source-descriptor-bound: Linux links an unnamed `O_TMPFILE`, while Windows
renames the retained file handle to a target derived from the retained directory
handle. Neither platform re-resolves a mutable staging pathname. Existing ledger permission modes
are bound before the copy and preserved on both replacement and rollback; a new
POSIX ledger remains owner-only, while the Windows read-only attribute is retained
without modifying linked inputs. Bootstrap failure ledgers also
refuse direct, hard-link, symlink, or source-boundary aliases of repository
inputs before writing.

Blind discovery is scored, not merely recorded: after the planner returns, its
selected skill paths must exactly match the hidden
`skills_expected_to_activate` oracle. Missing, wrong, extra, duplicate, unknown,
or non-responder selections fail before response generation. Generated ledger
rows bind every selected responder path to its frozen SHA-256 digest; fabricated,
non-canonical, missing, or mismatched provenance cannot produce a release pass.
The ledger also records one canonical SHA-256 over the complete frozen
path/role/hash map, including `SKILL.md`, fixtures, evaluator files, and the
source manifest itself, plus per-role file counts. Release assessment accepts
that provenance only from the verified `FrozenRepository`; caller-supplied
digest maps cannot stand in for the evaluated checkout.
The canonical eval-suite and rubric digests are pinned so a structurally valid
but semantically gutted replacement also fails closed.

Every declared case oracle reaches the judge through a stable opaque criterion
ID. Assertions, required output sections, forbidden behaviors, `expected_output`,
`failure_mode`, `expected_state_delta`, and `expected_prompt_architecture` are
scored as exact judge-only criteria; `expected_sequence_relation` is bound into
the routing dimension. These oracle values remain hidden from discovery and
response generation, so binding them does not undo the blind-selection boundary.

Result rows have an explicit evidence status. `scored` means the judge returned
a complete, strictly typed verdict with every criterion and dimension ID exactly
once; only these rows enter quality floors and averages. A judge transport error,
timeout, empty body, oversized body, malformed JSON, or incomplete/invalid
verdict becomes `harness_error` with no numeric score or pass value. The harness
continues the remaining selected cases, writes a fresh auditable ledger, excludes
the error row from quality arithmetic, marks release evidence `NOT ELIGIBLE`, and
exits 1. It never represents missing judge evidence as a poor-output score of 0.

Case-contract or response-envelope failures are different: they are known before
the first provider call, so the whole live run aborts with exit 2. If `--ledger`
was requested, the stale artifact is atomically replaced by a bootstrap
`harness_error` ledger. Post-run snapshot drift likewise makes every recorded row
a non-scored harness error and exits 2.

This is the model-response quality gate, not a shape gate or a language/rendering
certification, so it lives outside offline CI; the latest run evidence is
recorded in [`evals/eval-run-ledger.md`](evals/eval-run-ledger.md).
Language-quality review uses the independent evidence protocol in
[`multilingual-native-review.md`](references/multilingual-native-review.md). CI
validates recorded bindings and scoring, while the truth and adequacy of
reviewer reasoning remain manual judgments.

## Design Standard

The front page follows an editorial design system rather than default AI styling: warm ink and paper themes, a serif display face paired with monospace specification labels, a single amber accent, and hairline rules — no gradients, no glow. Camera motifs are deliberately retired: no viewfinder marks, timecode, record dots, or aspect badges. They depict the tool rather than the work, and they are the visual cliché of every AI-video product.

The masthead is generated from one geometry by [`scripts/build_hero.py`](scripts/build_hero.py), so its dark and light variants cannot drift apart; the isolated `python -I -S -B scripts/build_hero.py --check` command proves the committed SVGs still match the generator, and it runs in CI.

The outlined display type has a separate, build-only toolchain. Before changing
the wordmark or tagline geometry, run `python -I -S -B scripts/build_masthead_outlines.py`
and then `python -I -S -B scripts/build_hero.py`. A writing run first recreates a
dedicated, marker-protected venv outside the checkout. The clear target is rejected when it
is inside the repository, trust directory, Python installation, or a non-temp
home subtree; equals a protected root; or would contain the repository, home
directory, Python prefix, system temp root, or external trust directory. A
dedicated descendant of the system temp directory remains allowed. The installer
then uses pip's `--force-reinstall --require-hashes` against the resolved lock.
The selected wheel artifacts are retained in the build venv; their hashes, pip's install
report, and the sha256 of every locked-distribution file are sealed together,
and the installed import bytes are compared directly with those retained wheel
archives. The venv is created with `--without-pip`, so creation never starts its
runner. The parent then stores and re-verifies a separate trust record outside
the venv that binds the runner, config, trusted base Python, current builder
script, lock, and initialized marker; the runner bytes must match the trusted
stdlib venv launcher. Only then can the verified runner bootstrap bundled pip and
perform the hash-locked installation. After sealing, the parent promotes that
record only if those inputs are unchanged and binds the sealed marker too. A
no-site `python -I -S -B` child verifies the package seal before adding the dedicated
site-packages path or importing FontTools and uharfbuzz.
Inherited loader, Python, pip, and virtualenv hooks are removed from child
environments. The generator records the exact lock digest plus the FontTools,
uharfbuzz, and HarfBuzz versions in
`assets/masthead-outlines.json`. The current lock pins `uharfbuzz==0.55.0`, the
latest stable release shown by [official PyPI metadata](https://pypi.org/project/uharfbuzz/0.55.0/)
when the lock was reviewed on 2026-08-02; the newer 0.56 line was prerelease-only.
Its six hashes are the published CPython abi3 wheels for Windows x86-64, Linux
glibc/musl on x86-64 and ARM64, and macOS universal2. Before either SVG is
written, `build_hero.py` independently requires the exact lock path, lock-byte
digest, install policy, and builder-version map recorded in the outline asset,
then renders both themes in memory so a second-theme failure cannot leave a
half-updated pair.
To prepare a later read-only check without regenerating, run
`python -I -S -B scripts/build_masthead_outlines.py --install-build-deps` once and then
use `python -I -S -B scripts/build_masthead_outlines.py --check` offline. Both commands
resolve the same checkout-specific temp venv by default; CI passes an explicit
run-attempt-specific `--build-env` under `/tmp`, because the hosted Linux
`$RUNNER_TEMP` is below `$HOME` and the clear guard deliberately rejects home
descendants. The wheelhouse remains under `$RUNNER_TEMP`; it is read, not cleared.
A changed distribution file, retained wheel, install report, lock, runner, venv
config, builder script, marker, startup hook, external trust record, or structured
child result makes the offline check fail closed and requires a fresh install.

The masthead and the hand-built operating diagram (`assets/hero-dark.svg`, `assets/hero-light.svg`, `assets/skill-map.svg`) are served through a `prefers-color-scheme` picture element; generated bitmap art lives only in the curated visual gallery, including the text-rich infographics.

The README must stay readable in GitHub mobile, dark mode, and narrow widths. SVG assets must include `<title>` and `<desc>` elements, use internal CSS only, and avoid external fonts, scripts, or resources. Tokens and rules live in [`references/frontend-design-system.md`](references/frontend-design-system.md) and [`docs/frontend-redesign.md`](docs/frontend-redesign.md).
